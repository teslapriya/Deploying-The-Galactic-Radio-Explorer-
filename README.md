# Deploying-The-Galactic-Radio-Explorer
The GReX is an upcoming low-cost radio telescope that will search for the brightest fast radio bursts in the
universe. The GReX box comprises a comprehensive assortment of hardware components, including
Low-Noise Amplifiers (LNAs), SNAP boards, Front-End Modules (FEMs), Raspberry Pi, Field-Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and sources of power. The rationale behind housing all these components within an
aluminum box is to provide effective shielding against environmental factors such as rain, snow, and Radio
Frequency Interference (RFI). In our study, we present detailed methodologies for the assembly,
programming, and testing of the FEM within the GReX box. The box is deployed in an open-sky environment
for prolonged durations. To address thermal management concerns associated with the operational
electronics inside the box, we employ a heat sink design and incorporate thermal fans.
